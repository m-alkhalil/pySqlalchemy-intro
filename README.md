Demo, and how to use sqlalchemy in python


To interact with Databases in python:
  - Row SQL queries
  - SQL Query Builder
  - ORM: Object-Relational Mapping

Sqlalchemy
  is a popular Python library used for interacting with databases, It provides both a high-level ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and a low-level SQL expression language for querying and manipulating relational databases. SQLAlchemy is widely used because of its flexibility, scalability, and powerful features.


Two Main Components of SQLAlchemy:
  - SQLAlchemy ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): The ORM provides a way to map Python classes to database tables. This allows you to interact with the database using Python objects, allows to work with database records as if they were just Python objects.
  - SQL Expression Language (Core): This is a lower-level system that gives more control your SQL queries. It allows you to write SQL queries in a Pythonic way using expressions and objects. It's essentially a toolkit for building SQL queries programmatically.  write SQL queries without needing to use raw strings.
